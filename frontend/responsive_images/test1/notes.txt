To make sure these new pieces of HTML work in old browsers as well as current browsers, 
we can include a piece of JavaScript known as a polyfill. 
In this case, we'll be using a polyfill called picturefill.

picturefill can just be included in your project but if you want ot learn about it, check out: http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/

async attribute tells the browser it can load the script asynchronously, meaning it won't block HTML rendering and will just load whenever it can. Use async with scripts without dependencies.

width descriptor(ex: 2048w) tells the browser the width of the image 
pixel density descriptor (ex: 2x in  srcset="img/photo-@2x,jpg 2x, img/photo-@1x.jpg 1x")

why we need the width of the browser? - The browser doesn't know the width of an image until it's completely downloaded so, we need to tell the browser that a particular image is this wide and that way it can intelligently select the correct source
